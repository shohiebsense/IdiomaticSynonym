                "His first notable success came in 1866 with his “Lettres de mon Moulin,” a series of sketches and\n" +

                "obtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity. He belonged to the realistic school, and though he\n" +

                "almost “lived” them. This habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes his\n" +

                "what he calls the painful part of his labor. He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to his\n" +
                "troubadour instincts. The subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paper\n" +

                "his figures are already “on foot in his mind,” he loses no time in introducing them in full activity. The\n" +
                "greater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.\n" +
                "There are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains the\n" +
                "situation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actual\n" +
